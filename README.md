# Python-Crash-Course
A run by a newbie through the book by No Starch Press

# My motivation for finishing the book
Although i have heard that Python was easy to learn, I didn't really have a good grasp of the language as I didn't have a lot of experience with the language to begin with.

I have experiences with R and I was hoping to be able to map over my knowledge of Data Science to Python. I also heard the Python can do Object Oriented Programming and i was hoping to trasnfer my experience with Java into here too.

I will document what i learnt from each chapter that i thought was note worthy.

# Chapter 1 Getting Started
This is just installing Python and talks about the differences between Python 2 and 3. Not a lot of practical knowledge that I learnt.
